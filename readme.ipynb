    "The goal of this project is to study fluids often encountered in the food processing industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dressings, sauces and mayonaises are typically be described as [emulsions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion) obtained by mixing oil and water. Industrial partners in this project are eager to further develop modeling and simulations techniques to obtain a better grip on the batch production and long term storage of emulsions. This grip is obtained by a better understanding of the physical properties of the mixture in terms of the properties of the oil and water components. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider [mayonnaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayonnaise) as an emulsions obtained by mixing oil droplets in water. These emulsion can be described as [linear visco-elastic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscoelasticity). An important physical property in the study of emulsions is the [dynamic modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_modulus). The modulus is defined as the ratio of stress to strain under vibratory conditions. Given that strain is dimensionless, the dynamic modulus has the same units as stress. The dynamic modulus is complex-valued quantify. The real part is called the storage modulus and represents the elastic portion of the material. The imaginary part is called the loss modulus and represent the viscous part of the material. Our interest is understanding how the dynamic modulus of mayonaise dependent on its ingredients and how it evolves over the shell live time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>use of the Julia programming language</b> is an integral part of the learning objectives of this project. The spatial resolution required in this project leads to large scale linear systems. These large scale systems are cumbersome to solve without use of a compiled programming language. Julia merges the easy of use (Python like) with the speed of execution (C++) like. "
