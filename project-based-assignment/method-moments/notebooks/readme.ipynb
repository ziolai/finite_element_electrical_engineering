    "3. the milling process alters the particle size distribution and therefore the laminar viscosity of the pulp. In bringing the gap to the lab measurements, we suggest to perform lab measurements with pulp with the grinding process switched off;\n",
    "4. not sure whether merely modeling the lasminar viscosity of the pulp is sufficient. Not sure whether modeling the six components of the stress tensor (as in the Oldroyd-B model using the upper-convective derivative) is required here.  \n",

    "1. obtain mesh-independent results for the shear stress in the airgap. Else impossible to access whether results are due to the RANS turbulence closure model (standard k-epsilon model or otherwise) or the numerics of the discretization;   \n",
    "2. perform parameter studies to access how flow quantities of interest (the shear stress in the air gap, the outlet mass flow rate) depend on operating conditions (the angular velocity of the rotor, the surface roughess of the rotor, temperature of the fluid, viscosity of the fluid (artifically modified), the thickness of the airgap) and the geometry (outer boundaries, stent?) of the flow domain.
