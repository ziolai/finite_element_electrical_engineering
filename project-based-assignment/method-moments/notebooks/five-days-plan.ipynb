    "# Five Days Plan \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Goals:</b>\n",
    "1. introduce Julia as instrument to solve problems of TNO The Hague. Matlab to be phased out. TNO further stranger for students;  \n",
    "2. reduce wall clock time for assembly by replacing an interpreted double loop over all elements in the mesh (destination and source triangles) by a compiled version;\n",
    "3. parallel shared memory assembly;\n",
    "4. reduce the singularity of the seft-term using first integrate, then differentiate;\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Links</b>\n",
    "1. [TaylorSeries.jl](https://juliadiff.org/TaylorSeries.jl/stable/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Day 1: Interview - Refine Plan Below \n",
    "\n",
    "1. details function for first (inner) integral;\n",
    "3. agree on test data (location where to evaluate functiob) and test results for function for inner integral;\n",
    "4. agree on quadrature rules for prisms. Current product of quadrature on triangle and interval is used. No information of logarithmic singularity on the edges of the prism is exploited; \n",
    "5. details assembly matrix and vector for reference element. Agree on test data and test reference results;\n",
    "6. details assembly matrix and vector for physical element. Agree on test data and test reference results;\n",
    "7. details triangular meshes to be used for assembly. Pass Matlab meshes to Julia? Agree on test data and test reference results;\n",
    "8. details assembly matrix and vector for entire mesh. Agree on test data and test reference results;\n",
    "9. overall pseudo-code of entire code; \n",
    "\n",
    "## Day 2: Function for Analytical Expression of First (Inner) Integral \n",
    "\n",
    "Include testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Day 3: Matrix and Vector of Single Triangular Element \n",
    "\n",
    "Include testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Day 4: Matrix and Vector Assembly - Linear Solve - Post-Processing \n",
    "\n",
    "Include testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Day 5: Buffer "
