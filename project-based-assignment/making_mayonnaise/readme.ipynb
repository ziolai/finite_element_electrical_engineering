    "Dressings, sauces and mayonaises are typically be described as [emulsions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion) obtained by mixing oil and water. Industrial partners in this project are eager to further develop modeling and simulations techniques to obtain a better grip on the batch production and long term storage of emulsions. This grip is obtained by a better understanding of the physical properties of the mixture in terms of the properties of the oil and water components. This is the field of [rheology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheology). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider [mayonnaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayonnaise) as an emulsions obtained by mixing oil droplets in water. These emulsion can be described as [linear visco-elastic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscoelasticity). An important physical property in the study of emulsions is the [dynamic modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_modulus). The modulus is defined as the ratio of stress to strain under vibratory conditions. Given that strain is dimensionless, the dynamic modulus has the same units as stress (units Pa = N/m$^2$). The dynamic modulus is complex-valued quantify. The real part is called the storage modulus (reflecting recoverable energy) and represents the elastic portion of the material. The imaginary part is called the loss modulus (related to energy dissipation) and represent the viscous part of the material. Our interest is understanding how the dynamic modulus of mayonaise dependent on its ingredients and how it evolves over the shell live time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Representative values of the dynamic modulus: \n",
    "1. water: the dynamic modulus of water is approximately 2.1 to 2.2 GPa (hard to compress);\n",
    "2. milk: between 500 MPa and 2500 MPa. See e.g. Ozer-1998, <i>Gelation Properties of Milk Concentratedby Diﬀerent Techniques</i>;\n",
    "3. butter: see e.g. [link](https://www.rheologylab.com/articles/food/butter-v-margarine-spread/);  \n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>use of the Julia programming language</b> is an integral part of the learning objectives of this project. The spatial resolution required in this project leads to large scale linear systems. These large scale systems are cumbersome to solve without use of a compiled programming language. Julia merges the easy of use (Python like) with the speed of execution (C++) like. "

Same paper reports on numerical results with $a=5$ nanometers, $a=50$ nanometers, $a=500$ nanometers,\n",

Also referred to as effective spring constant. Clearly independent of frequency of shearing force. Assumption is that the emulsion is in the state in which the shear tension responds linear to the shear rate. In this state the definition as second order derivative applies;\n",

    "## Section 6: Expert Level: Rotating-Lid-Driven Cavity Stokes Flow for Shear-Thinning Non-Newtonian Fluid\n",
    "\n",
    "(Include schematic representation from the book).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1.6: Pre-Processor \n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessor consist of the following two components: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. geometry modeling tool;\n",
    "2. mesh generation tool;  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first component is the geometry modeler.  This modeler is either implements a form of [constructive solid geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry) or allows to import a geometry definition from file in standard definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second component is the mesh generation tool. Here we use [GMSH](https://gmsh.info). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the preprocessor should generate a mesh on the cylindrical cavity of the rheometer in which the sample resides. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Coding</b>: see seperate notebook [gmsh_cavity.ipynb](gmsh_cavity.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2.6: Computational Kernel \n",
    "\n",
    "The computational kernel assumes the responses of the sample to the excitation of the rheometer to be modeled in terms of physical laws of conservation (conservastion of mass and momentum) and constituive laws of the material (stress-strain relation). Given these models, the computational kernel consists of the following three four components: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. read the mesh;\n",
    "2. discretize the conservation and constitutive equations in space and time;\n",
    "3. solve the discrete model in space and time;\n",
    "4. write snapshots for spatial distribution of velocity, strain and stress to file for visualization;\n",
    "   \n",
    "Simulations reported here were performed using the [Ferrite](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/Ferrite.jl/stable/) finite element software.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3.6: Scalar Diffusion \n",
    "\n",
    "A elementary proof of concept is to solve a scalar diffusion eqiation on the volume (computational domain) of a cylindrical cavity. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Coding</b>: see seperate notebook [ferrite_diffusion_cavity.ipynb](ferrite_diffusion_cavity.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 4.6: Stationary Stokes Flow of a Newtonian Fluid \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we consider the rotation of the lid covering the cylindrical cavity to be modeled by a overly simplified [Stokes flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_flow) model for a [Newtonian fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_fluid).  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Coding</b>: see seperate notebook [ferrite_stokes_cavity.ipynb](ferrite_stokes_cavity.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 5.6: Transient Navier-Stokes Flow of a Newtonian Fluid\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we extend flow Stokes to [Navier-Stokes flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier–Stokes_equations), thus including non-linear convective terms. We also include time-dependent terms;\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Coding</b>: see seperate notebook [ferrite_navier_stokes_cavity.ipynb](ferrite_navier_stokes_cavity.ipynb) (in progress).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 6.6: Post-Processor \n",
    "\n",
    "Resultsa are visualized using [paraview](https://www.paraview.org). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 7.6: Preliminary Results \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show computational results for the magnitude of the velocity for Stokes flow. \n",
