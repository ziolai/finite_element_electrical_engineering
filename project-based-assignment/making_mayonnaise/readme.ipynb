    "The goal of this project is to study fluids often encountered in the food processing industry. \n",

    "<b>What is mayonnaise?</b> [Mayonnaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayonnaise) is a mixture of vegetable oil (oil droplets, disperse phase, more on vegetable oil properties), egg yoke (continuous phase, continous phase, described as water, more on what is missed by this approximation) and egg white (proteins, emulsifier, more on these terms mean). Distinguish between regular (high oil content, concentrated, compressed, high internal phase) and low-fat mayonnaise. Similar fluids of interests are sauces and dressings. Industrial partners in this project are eager to further develop modeling and simulations techniques to obtain a better grip on the batch production and long term storage of mayonnaise (instability of mayonnaise, loss of elasticity, loss of matching in buoyancy, flocculation, phase seperation, population balance models). This grip is obtained by a better understanding of the physical properties of the mixture. The fact that these fluids are intended as nutrition adds to the modeling challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What is an emulsions?</b> Wikipedia describes an [emulsions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion) as a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible owing to liquid-liquid phase separation. Mayonnaise is an example. An example of emulsions without the (chemical and biological) complexity of mayonnaise is [boger fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_viscosity_elastic_fluid). (How does rheometry data for a Boger fluid look like? Does this data exihibit a plateau shear modulus? Can this data be fitted with a small set of relaxation modes? What is the value of the plateau elastic modulus? What is the shape of the plateau zone? See [Kaur-Sobti-Wanchoo-2024](https://www-sciencedirect-com.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S2405830023001234?via%3Dihub). Computes relaxation time as the sum of relaxation times of indidividual modes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What is a surfactant?</b> Distinguish between anionic, nonionic, zwitterion and gemini surfactant? \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What is a visco-elastic fluid?</b> Wikipedia describes [visco-elastic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscoelasticity) as material property that combines both viscous and elastic characteristics. Constitutive stress-strain equations for these materials thus need to include both elastic (stress proportional to gradient of displacement, Hooke Law) and viscous effects (stress proportional to gradient of velocity). Examples are mixture of (soft or hard) spheres in water and mayonnaise. (Distinguish between linear and non-linear visco-elastic materials. Elaborate on constitutive equations for visco-elastic materials. Course notes on [visco-elasticity](https://web.mit.edu/course/3/3.11/www/modules/visco.pdf). Can the Boltzman integral representation be used to construct frequency-domain data consisting of various relaxation modes?). \n",

    "<b>What are constitutive equations for visco-elastic fluid?</b>\n",
    "1. single relaxation time [Kelvin-Voigt model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin–Voigt_material) (parallel spring-dashpot) (how to model the energy stored in on Maxwell model? How to recover the real part of the dynamic modulus for the second derivative of the energy wrt strain rate?); \n",
    "2. single relaxation time [Maxwell model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_model) (series spring-dashpot) (as before);\n",
    "3. list more elaborate models here;\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What is the dynamic modulus?</b> An important physical property in the study of emulsions is the [dynamic modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_modulus). This modulus generalizes the notion of elasticity and viscosity. The modulus is defined as the ratio of stress to strain under vibratory conditions. Given that strain is dimensionless, the dynamic modulus has the same units as stress (units Pa = N/m$^2$). The dynamic modulus is complex-valued quantify. The real part is called the storage modulus (reflecting recoverable energy) and represents the elastic portion of the material. The imaginary part is called the loss modulus (related to energy dissipation) and represent the viscous part of the material. Our interest is two-fold. Our first interest is understanding how the dynamic modulus of mayonaise depends on factors such as its ingredients (type of oil, quantity of oil, type of emulsifier) and its micro-structure (oil droplet size distribution). Our second interest is understanding how the dynamic modulus of mayonaise evolves over the shell live time. \n",

    "<b>What is the plateau modulus?</b> Give definition and properties (amplitude and extend in frequency). Cite Liu-2006 paper {\\em Evaluation of different methods for the determination of the plateau modulus and the entanglement molecular weight}. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What is shear thinning?</b> More on the role of the viscosity and its decrease as shear is applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>How is the dynamic modulus modeled?</b> The dynamic modulus of a visco-elastic fluid can be modeled from first principles (by energy minimization followed by suitable thermo-dynamical derivatives), by molecular dynamics simulations, by fluid dynamics simulations (as the auto-correlation of the shear stress), by symbolic regression of measured data or by least-squares fitting to measured data.    \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>How is the dynamic modulus measured?</b> The dynamic modulus of mayonaise can be measured using [dynamic mechanical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_mechanical_analysis) (general term) and [rheometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheometry) (more specific terms). In these experiments the stress caused by a (linear or rotating) strain is measured. Measurement using Small Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (SAOS), using Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS), yield stress, frequency range, measured values of $G'(\\omega)$ and $G''(\\omega)$. This [video](https://www.rheologylab.com/videos/) explains oscillatory stress sweeps.\n",

    "With 15 lines, Leandro Martinez (@lmiq) writes a code to perform a particle simulation with periodic boundary conditions, a langevin thermostat, a quadratic potential between the particles, and produce an animation (see below). \n",

    "3. assume a computed mixture fraction on a uniform mesh. Compute the partion function on this mesh;  \n",

    "5. differentiate the force vector $\\mathbf{F}_i$ on particle $i$ wrt its position vector $\\mathbf{x}_i$ (thus obtaining the second derivative of the energy) to obtain the coefficients in the constitutive force-strain relation;\n",
    "6. repeat above for alternative choices of the potential between particles. Choices include adding a cubic term to the potential (Duffing oscillators), Langevin and Van der Waals potentials. Verify whether the later allow to take particle sizes into account;\n",
    "7. convert script into a function allowing Julia to compile the function for you, thus reducing wall clock time;\n",
