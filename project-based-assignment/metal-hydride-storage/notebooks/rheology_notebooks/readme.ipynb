    "## Section 1: Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Motivated by the fact that: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. rheometer fails to provide sufficient resolution to detect (to measure) the effect (influence) of spatial variations in micro-structure (e.g. non-uniformity of particle size distribution) of the spatial distribution of stress and strain (dilatational and shear);\n",
    "3. public domain simulations tools are abundantly available;\n",
    "4. computationally performant hardware is cheap;\n",
    "\n",
    "we wish to develop a digital twin of the rheometer in finite elements. This digital twin is expected to provide information on spatial distribution of strain, stress and elastic modulus. This digital twin should be able to mimmic the effect of frequency sweeps, amplitude sweeps and flow curves on the measured sample.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2: Components of a Digital Twin \n",
    "\n",
    "We define a digital twin to be a simulation model consisting of the following three components: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. pre-processor;\n",
    "2. computational kernel;\n",
    "3. post-processor;\n",
    "\n",
    "These components are explained in more details in the following three sections\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 3: Pre-Processor \n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessor consist of the following two components: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. geometry modeling tool;\n",
    "2. mesh generation tool;  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first component is the geometry modeler.  This modeler is either implements a form of [constructive solid geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry) or allows to import a geometry definition from file in standard definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second component is the mesh generation tool. Here we use [GMSH](https://gmsh.info). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the preprocessor should generate a mesh on the cylindrical cavity of the rheometer in which the sample resides. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Coding</b>: see seperate notebook [gmsh_cavity.ipynb](gmsh_cavity.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 4: Computational Kernel \n",
    "\n",
    "The computational kernel assumes the responses of the sample to the excitation of the rheometer to be modeled in terms of physical laws of conservation (conservastion of mass and momentum) and constituive laws of the material (stress-strain relation). Given these models, the computational kernel consists of the following three four components: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. read the mesh;\n",
    "2. discretize the conservation and constitutive equations in space and time;\n",
    "3. solve the discrete model in space and time;\n",
    "4. write snapshots for spatial distribution of velocity, strain and stress to file for visualization;\n",
    "   \n",
    "Simulations reported here were performed using the [Ferrite](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/Ferrite.jl/stable/) finite element software.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1.4: Scalar Diffusion \n",
    "\n",
    "A elementary proof of concept is to solve a scalar diffusion eqiation on the volume (computational domain) of a cylindrical cavity. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Coding</b>: see seperate notebook [ferrite_diffusion_cavity.ipynb](ferrite_diffusion_cavity.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2.4: Stationary Stokes Flow of a Newtonian Fluid \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we consider the rotation of the lid covering the cylindrical cavity to be modeled by a overly simplified [Stokes flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_flow) model for a [Newtonian fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_fluid).  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Coding</b>: see seperate notebook [ferrite_stokes_cavity.ipynb](ferrite_stokes_cavity.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3.4: Transient Navier-Stokes Flow of a Newtonian Fluid\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we extend flow Stokes to [Navier-Stokes flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navierâ€“Stokes_equations), thus including non-linear convective terms. We also include time-dependent terms;\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Coding</b>: see seperate notebook [ferrite_navier_stokes_cavity.ipynb](ferrite_navier_stokes_cavity.ipynb) (in progress).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 5: Post-Processor \n",
    "\n",
    "Resultsa are visualized using [paraview](https://www.paraview.org). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 6: Preliminary Results \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show computational results for the magnitude of the velocity for Stokes flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./stokes_3d_cylinder.png\" width=400 />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 7: Conclusions \n",
    "\n",
    "Requires extensions: \n",
    "1. preprocessor: explore more refined mesh generation techniques to obtaibn finer meshes near the circumferential and bottom boundary of the cylindrical cavity at limited cell count. These meshes should enable to accurately represent the flow in the boundary layers;\n",
    "1. preprocessor: represent a wedge (sector) of the cylindrical wedge only;\n",
    "3. computational kernel: inquire about representative Reynolds and Strouhald (vortex shedding) number \n",
    "4. computational kernel: extend constitutive equation from Newtonian to non-Newtonian with a power-law for viscosity to represent the [shear-thinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_thinning) behavior of the sample;\n",
    "5. post-processor: extend to visualize strain, stress and elastic modulus;\n",
    "6. simulation setp-up: extend to replicate reaslistic measurement protocols;  "
