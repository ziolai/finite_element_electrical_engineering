    "## Remy Morel - Summer Internship \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Introduction</b>: The summer internship of Remi Morel at the Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics at the Technical University of Delft is scheduled to take place from July 2025 to September 2025. During this internship, Remi is expected to contribute to the mathematical  modeling and numerical simulation of the storage of hydrogen gas using metal-organic frameworks as binding agent. The project is part of a collaboration between Almajdouie - deRijke and TU Delft described at [1]. A first milestone is the project is to reproduce results published in the literature using of public domain software tools. This milestone is described at [2]. The model described in [2] consists of two components. The first component is a model for the laminar non-isothermal flow of hydrogen gas in the storage container filled with a metal-oxide framework. The metal-oxide can be considered to be a porous medium through which the hydrogen gas flows. The second component is a two-component convection-diffusion-reaction model for the hydrogen gas and metal-oxide densities. The model is solved using the finite element method for the spatial discretization and an implicit time integration method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main target of the summer internship of Remi Morel is to contribute to solving the assignment outlined at [2]. Other references are available at The internship requests Remi to go through a short and superficial literature study on storage of hydrogen gas using metal-oxide frameworks and of mathematical models for this application. The paper referenced in [2] can be used as a point of departure. The internship furthermore foresees in the possibility that Remi seeks advice from a student working previous on the project (Ms. Anouchka Desmettre) on software tools to be used in the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important ingredient is to account for the effect of temperature gradients on the absorption and release of hydrogen (heat required for absorption and released due to desorption of hydrogen). Both steady-state (quantifying the amount of hydrogen absorbed and released) and transient (quantifying the time required for (de)charging) models are of interest to developed. This requires to study the heat transfer through the porous medium of the metal-oxide framework by diffusion and laminar convection. Initially adiabatic models can be investigated. In a later stage, the heat loss to the environment can be taken into account by imposing suitable boundary conditions. The iso-thermal flow will have to be extended with an equation for the energy (temperature) and with the equation of state for an ideal gas (hydrogen).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, [Ferrite.jl](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/Ferrite.jl/stable/) contains a tutorial for the steady-state [Stokes](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/Ferrite.jl/stable/tutorials/stokes-flow/) and the transient [incompressible Navier-Stokes](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/Ferrite.jl/stable/tutorials/ns_vs_diffeq/) problem. Both tutorials assume iso-thermal (no heat transfer) conditions. These models, therefore, will need to be extended to take heat transfer into account. Both the Stokes and Navier-Stokes tutorial form the Jacobian for pressure-velocity coupling as a 2-by-2 block sparse system. In the Stokes problem, this Jacobian is symmetric and indefinite. A single solve of a system of linear equations is required (in the absence of pressure inlet boundary conditions). The Stokes tutorial currently implements a sparse direct solver. In the Navier-Stokes problem instead, the Jacobian is non-symmetric due to the convective terms. A non-linear system of equations need to be solved within a transient loop. The linear system within the Newton is again solved using a sparse direct solver. \n",

    "<b>Approach</b>: We suggest to go through the following steps (requires more details) (should Remy take porous medium into account?): \n",
    "\n",
    "1. iso-thermal flow: modify the geometry and mesh generation of the Stokes and Navier-Stokes tutorial to obtain iso-thermal flow through a channel or into a reactor vessel. Define and run case set-up (how do heat effects affect the flow?). Verify computed results; \n",

    "3. Oseen flow: extend the Stokes tutorial to Oseen flow (thus including convective transport by the flow, single linear system with modified Jacobian of the Navier-Stokes tutorial) as an intermediate step;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. passive transport: extend the Stokes and Navier-Stokes tutorials with the transport of a passive scalar (e.g. a dye in the flow) in post-processing of the flow solve;\n",
    "\n",
    "5. include heat transfer effect: how does injecting cold and hot gas into a tank differ?: extend in the the Navier-Stokes tutorial the 2-by-2 block sparse Jacobian for pressure-velocity coupling to a 3-by-3 block sparse Jacobian for the pressure-velocity-temperature coupling. Use a sparse direct solver as before. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. computational efficiency: (if time allows) replace the sparse direct solver $u = K \\backslash f$ by an iterative solution. We wish to solve the Stokes and Oseen problem using a GMRES iteration (see e.g. [KrylovKit.jl](https://jutho.github.io/KrylovKit.jl/stable/)) preconditioned first using a variant of ILU (see e.g. [Preconditioners.jl](https://julialinearalgebra.github.io/Preconditioners.jl/stable/)) and later using a Schur complement for the pressure variables. The Schur complement should be approximately solved using algebraic multigrid method (see e.g. [AlgebraicMultigrid.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/AlgebraicMultigrid.jl)). The velocity components and temperature will be solved in other blocks of the preconditioner. For the Navier-Stokes problem, this apprach is to be incorporated within the Newton procedure within each timmer step.
