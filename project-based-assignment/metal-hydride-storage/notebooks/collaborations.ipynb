    "## Remy Morel - Summer Internship \n",
    "\n",
    "The summer internship of Remi Morel at the Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics at the Technical University of Delft is scheduled to take place from July 2025 to September 2025. During this internship, Remi is expected to contribute to the mathematical  modeling and numerical simulation of the storage of hydrogen gas using metal-organic frameworks as binding agent. The project is part of a collaboration between Almajdouie - deRijke and TU Delft described at [1]. A first milestone is the project is to reproduce results published in the literature using of public domain software tools. This milestone is described at [2]. The model described in [2] consists of two components. The first component is a model for the laminar non-isothermal flow of hydrogen gas in the storage container filled with a metal-oxide framework. The metal-oxide can be considered to be a porous medium through which the hydrogen gas flows. The second component is a two-component convection-diffusion-reaction model for the hydrogen gas and metal-oxide densities. The model is solved using the finite element method for the spatial discretization and an implicit time integration method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main target of the summer internship of Remi Morel is to contribute to solving the assignment outlined at [2]. Other references are available at The internship requests Remi to go through a short and superficial literature study on storage of hydrogen gas using metal-oxide frameworks and of mathematical models for this application. The paper referenced in [2] can be used as a point of departure. The internship furthermore foresees in the possibility that Remi seeks advice from a student working previous on the project (Ms. Anouchka Desmettre) on software tools to be used in the project. \n",

    "An important ingredient is to account for the effect of temperature gradients on the absorption and release of hydrogen (heat required for absorption and released due to desorption of hydrogen). Both steady-state (quantifying the amount of hydrogen absorbed and released) and transient (quantifying the time required for (de)charging) models are of interest to developed. This requires to study the heat transfer through the porous medium of the metal-oxide framework by diffusion and laminar convection. The Stokes, Oseen and Navier-Stokes pressure-velocity models for iso-thermal flow will have to be extended with an equation for the energy (temperature) and with the equation of state for an ideal gas. Both segregated and coupled solution approaches can be investigated.  Initially adiabatic models will be investigated. In a later stage, the heat loss to the environment can be taken into account by imposing suitable boundary conditions. Other aspects that are of interest to pursue are listed as exercises in [2]. \n",

    "The summer internship of Remi Morel is expected to result in a Jupyter notebook (or a set of interlinked Jupyter notebooks) for the Julia programming language. Numerical  results of the internship will be bundled with other results and shared with project partners. \n",
