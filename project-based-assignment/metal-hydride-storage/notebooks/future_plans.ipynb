    "Implement a total pressure inlet condition. This inlet condition replaces the velocity inlet condition currently being used. The [total pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle#Simplified_form) $p_{tot}$ is defined as the sum of the static pressure $p_{stat}$ (the pressure solved for) and the dynamic pressure $p_{dyn} = p_{stat} + \\rho (u^2 + v^2 + w^2)$. \n",

The former is a functional of the velocity components $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ and the static pressure $p_{stat}(x,y)$ that the code solves for. The latter is a a-priori given value. The residual in the total pressure on the inlet is then given by $R[u,v,p_{stat}] = p_{tot-comp} - p_{tot-pres}$. We wish to minimize the weighted square of the residual on the inlet, i.e., solve for $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ and $p_{stat}(x,y)$ such that \n",
