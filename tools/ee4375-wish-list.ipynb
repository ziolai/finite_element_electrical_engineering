    "1. Q1: (build rhs vector): Assume given the computational domain $\\Omega = (0,1)^2$ as before. Assume the source term $f(x,y)$ to be a Guassian function centered in $(x_0,y_0) = (0.5, 0.5)$ and deviation $\\sigma = 0.1$, that is, $f(x,y) = \\exp[-(x-x_0)^2/(2\\,\\sigma^2)-(y-y_0)^2/(2\\,\\sigma^2)]$.  Assume solving the Poisson equation $- \\bigtriangleup u(x,y) = f(x,y)$ on $\\Omega$ supplied with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(x,y) = 0$ on $\\Gamma = \\partial \\Omega$. Assume a uniform mesh on $\\Omega$ with $N=8$ elements in both the $x$-directon and the $y$-direction. Assume this uniform mesh to be denoted by $\\Omega^h$. Assume the all the grid nodes (on the interior and the boundary) to be numbered using a $x-$lexicografic ordering. Assume solving the Poisson equation using a five-point central finite difference scheme. Implement a Julia function that takes as input the integer $N$ and the function $f(x,y)$ and that returns the right-hand side vector ${\\mathbf f}$ defined on $\\Omega^h$. This function should take both the interior and boundary nodes into account. Assume $N=8$. Use the @test macro defined by unit test module to test the output of the function with the reference right-hand side vector provided with this homework assignment. Assume $N=32$. Make a contour plot of the vector ${\\mathbf f}$ on the mesh $\\Omega^h$; \n",

Use the @test macro to test the output of the function with the reference matrix provided with this homework assignment; \n",
    "3. Q3: (build solution vector): Same assumptions as in Q1. Implement a Julia function that takes as input the matrix $A$ from Q2 and the vector ${\\mathbf f}$ from Q1 and that computes the solution vector ${\\mathbf u}$. Assume $N=8$. Use the @test macro to test the output of the function with the reference solution vector provided with this homework assignment. Assume $N=32$.

The matrix $B_x$ is of size $N^2$-by-$(N+1)^2$ is obtained as obtained as $B_x = \\text{one-dimensional}(B)_x \\otimes I$ (and $B_y = I \\times \\text{one-dimensional}(B)_y$). The matrix $B$ is obtained by vertically stacking the matrix $B_x$ and $B_y$. That is, $B$ is a rectangular matrix of size $2\\,N^2$-by-$(N+1)^2$ such that the matrix-vector multiplication $B \\, {\\mathbf u}$ hold the gradient of the vector ${\\mathbf u}$ computed by a forward finite difference scheme. This means that $[{\\mathbf u}_x; {\\mathbf u}_y] = B \\, {\\mathbf u} = [B_x; B_y] \\, {\\mathbf u} = [B_x \\, {\\mathbf u}; B_y \\, {\\mathbf u}]$.
